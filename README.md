# A statistical analysis with interactive graphs to explore data of conflicts in between the state and the rebels in the African continent. 

A growing fraction of the world's civil wars seem to be breaking out on the African continent in the last few decades. Specifically, conflicts in between rebels and the state exerts a major negative impact on the society. Political violence in Africa is a complex subject, thus it will be useful to note a few trends in African terrorism. I examined a longitudinal sample of political violence in African countries between the years 1997-2020 available in Armed Conflict Location and Event Data for the purpose of this analysis.

The general outline of this notebook is as follows:
1. Descriptive analysis of rebel conflicts.
2. Explore the conflicts by month and type.
3. Explore the conflicts and fatalities by month and country.
4. Compare the incidence of conflicts by year.

The goals of this study:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis of Terrorism data in African countries
2. Incorporate dummy coding and data aggregation techniques.
3. Data visualization using interactive plots and maps.
4. Practice tabular data extraction and manipulation for an efficient analysis.
5. Use different python librarires (e.g. pandas, numpy, ipywidgets, geopandas etc.)
